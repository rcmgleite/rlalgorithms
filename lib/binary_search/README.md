## Basic idea
Search for a value inside a sorted array by recursively "cutting" the search area in half.

## Tree representation

The array A = [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14] can be represented like this:

![alt text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree#/media/File:Binary_search_tree.svg)

To find the value 7, we need to:

1. Compare 7 with the root node (8). As it's lower than 8, go left.
2. Compare 7 with 3. As it's higher than 3, go right.
3. Comprare 7 with 6. As it's highres than, 6, go right.
4. Finally, found 7.

By inspecting this tree, it's easy to see that the number of steps to find a value using binary search is proportional to the
height of the tree.

### Now, how do we compute the hight of a binary tree like this?

Let's start by the number of nodes in a [complete binary tree](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/Cs163/Doc/FullvsComplete.html)

![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n&space;=&space;\sum_{k=0}^{h}{x^{k-1}}&space;$)

This is a geometric progression with ration = 2.
The Sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression is:
![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Sn&space;=&space;a_1&space;*&space;(q^n&space;-&space;1)&space;/&space;(q&space;-&space;1))
where 
a1 - is the first term of the progrssion
q - ration - in our case, 2.
n - nuber of terms - in out case, h.

Therefore, ![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n&space;=&space;2^h&space;-&space;1)

By applying log2 to both sides of the equation we endup with:
![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?2^h&space;=&space;n&space;&plus;&space;1)
![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?log_2(2^h)&space;=&space;log_2(n&plus;1))
![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?h&space;=&space;log_2(n&plus;1))

Finally, the height of the binary search tree is proportional to log(n) and this height dictates the time complexity of the binary search algorithm.
